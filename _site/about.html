For a period of two years, I will be working for the <a href="http://www.amicaproject.be/">AMiCA project</a> where my research will mainly be in the field of Text Mining. During this, I focus on applying Machine Learning for forensic and online security-related applications such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling.</p><h2 id="academic-background">Academic Background</h2><p>After obtaining a BA in Communication and Information Sciences from Tilburg University, I realized soon enough that Artificial Intelligence and programming were very much my thing. Hence, I stayed in Tilburg and obtained an MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude. I wrote quite the pile of pages that made my master thesis under the supervision of <a href="linky">Menno van Zaanen</a> on discovering trends in societal debates by means of Supervised Topic Modelling on online news sources, for which I had the honour of receiving two awards (<a href="http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation">Leo Coolen</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944">STIL</a>). With my newly developed admiration for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, I sought to continue research and applied (and got hired) for a PhD position in Antwerp.</p><h2 id="development">Development</h2><p>During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became an avid Linux user and got very enthusiastic about open-source software, and thus open data and open science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of my student assistantship activites. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for websites, wrappers, and tools. My latest endeavors include a minimalistic conference manager (<a href="https://www.github.com/cmry/ebacs">ebacs</a>), a Python wrapper for Stanford&#39;s Topic Modelling Toolbox (<a href="https://www.github.com/cmry/shed">shed</a>), and an environment for Computational Linguistics research (to be published).
