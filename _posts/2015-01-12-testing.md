Welcome to my blog, which I intend to use to waste some time elucidating my programming-related activities. As a Ph.D. in [Text Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) and a 'casual' web developer, I regularly work with languages such as Python, LaTeX, R, and PHP. Having had much aid during my 
many coding sessions from various blogs and Q&A's, I decided that it might be good to give back to the community, so to say. I will try to mainly focus on interesting snippets rather than more introductory stuff, which you will hopefully find interesting and helpful.
