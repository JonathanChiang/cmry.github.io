Over the last few weeks, I have been working on a python script that can convert an XML file generated by [EasyChair](http://easychair.org/) to a Book of Abstracts used at conferences. One of the problems I faced was that I had to create a custom Table of Contents with the title of the submitted abstracts and their page number, and its authors below.

{% highlight text %}
1 Abstracts
   This is an abstract ................... 1
   Author 1, Author 2, Author 3
{% endhighlight %}
