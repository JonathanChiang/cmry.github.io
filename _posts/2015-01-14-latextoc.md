Over the last few weeks, I have been working on a `python` script that can convert an `XML` file generated by [EasyChair](http://easychair.org/) to a Book of Abstracts used at conferences. One of the problems I faced was that I had to create a custom Table of Contents with the title of the submitted abstracts and their page number, and its authors below.

{% highlight text %}
1 Abstracts
   This is an abstract ................... 1
   Author 1, Author 2, Author 3
{% endhighlight %}

Luckily, `LaTeX` allows for adding custom entries to the table of contents. So there is no need to mess around with adding the abstracts as real sections, messing up the lay-out etc. This is commonly done with `\addcontentstoline{toc}{section}{title}`. In text example:

{% highlight latex %} 
\chapter{Abstracts}
\newpage

\addcontentstoline{toc}{section}{This is an abstract} 

\center{
  \large{\textbf{This is an abstract}}
  Author 1, Author 2, Author 3
}
{% endhighlight %}

After which we should see the following:
{% highlight text %} 
This is an abstract ................... 1 
{% endhighlight %}

Now comes the tricky part, though, as adding the authors to the section title is obviously not something we would want. We cannot use the `\addcontentstoline` either, as that would result in the following:

{% highlight text %} 
This is an abstract ................... 1 
Author 1, Author 2, Author 3 .......... 1
{% endhighlight %}

Yeah, not really pretty. We do not specifically have to add to
a section though, as `\addcontents{toc}{text}` can be used to add the list of authors. Adding some spacing here and there would look something like:

{% highlight latex %} 
%...

\addcontentstoline{toc}{section}{This is an abstract} 
\addcontents{toc}{\protect\vspace{0.2em}}
\addcontents{toc}{Author 1, Author 2, Author 3}

\center{
  \large{\textbf{This is an abstract}}
  Author 1, Author 2, Author 3
}
{% endhighlight %}
