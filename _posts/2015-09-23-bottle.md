At some point in life, one might consider moving away from classic web
development in for example PHP, and move on to 'easier' stuff. If you already
know a language, learning another one just for web development can also seem
like a waste of time. It might be more elegant, flexible, better integrated
with the things you're currently writing. I found myself in the position of
having to demo my work on [author profiling](https://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/events/pan-15/pan15-web/author-profiling.html)
that was completely written in Python 3 (shed + sklearn). It's been a bumpy
road to say the least, so to help any pursuers of this path in the future, I
hereby present you with my findings thus far.

## Bottle.py

[Bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) is a very minimalistic web-
framework for Python. It is so small that delivering `hello world` to a port is
literally this:

{% highlight python %}
from bottle import route, run

@route('/')
def index():
    return "hello world"

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
{% endhighlight %}


It works with all your existing code and libraries that Python has. So say that
you want to test an already trained [bigram](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#common-vectorizer-usage)
SVM classifier on data fed by a query it can be as much as:

{% highlight python %}
from bottle import route, run
import sklearn
import pickle

@route('/<query>')
def index(query):
    clf = pickle.load(open('/somedir/model.pickle', 'rb'))
    big = pickle.load(open('/somedir/bigram_vectorizer.picke', 'rb'))
    v = big.transform([query]).toarray()
    return clf.predict(v)[0]

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
{% endhighlight %}

This is all well and good, until you actually want to implement your app in an
existing web server environment. Chances are huge that this will be in Apache.
Traditional protocols for Apache do not handle these kind of apps, though, and
so WSGI was brought to life.

## Apache & WSGI

Without filling this post with the [specifics](http://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html)
and motivations behind WSGI, let's immediately jump into how to configure
Bottle.py and Apache to run this stuff. First we need to do a bit of work in
our `whatever.py` that had the bottle code. After renaming it to `app.wsgi` it
should contain the following:
