title: Python 3, Bottle.py, Apache and WSGI - Import

At some point in life, one might consider moving away from classic web
development in for example PHP, and move on to 'easier' stuff. If you already
know a language, learning another one just for web development can also seem
like a waste of time. It might be more elegant, flexible, better integrated
with the stuff you're currently writing. I found myself in the position of
having to demo my work on [author profiling](https://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/events/pan-15/pan15-web/author-profiling.html)
that was completely written in Python 3 (shed + sklearn). It's been a bumpy
road to say the least, so to help any pursuers of this path in the future, I
hereby present you with my findings thus far.

## Bottle.py

[Bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) is a very minimalistic web-
framework for Python. It is so small that delivering `hello world` to a port is
literally this:

{% highlight python %}
from bottle import route, run

@route('/')
def index():
    return "hello world"

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
{% endhighlight %}


It works with all your existing code and libraries that Python has. So say that
you want to test a bigram SVM classifier on data fed by a query it can be as
much as:


{% highlight python %}
from bottle import route, run
import sklearn
import pickle

@route('/<query>')
def index(query):
    clf = pickle.load(open('/somedir/model.pickle', 'rb'))

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
{% endhighlight %}
