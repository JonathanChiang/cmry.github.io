I'm a [Lecturer](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/c.d.emmery.htm)
at Tilburg University, as well as a joint [PhD
candidate](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/chris-emmery) doing research
for both the [CS&AI group](https://tcsai.github.io) at Tilburg and
[CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University of Antwerp under the
supervision of [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl), [Grzegorz
Chrupa≈Ça](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me), and [Walter
Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/). I currently teach [Text
Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=N&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880091) and
[Social Data
Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=e&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880022) in
context of the new [Data
Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-business-and-governance/)
master. Before, I worked for the [AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/)
where my research was mainly in the field of Text Mining. During this, I
focussed on applying Machine Learning for forensic and online security-related
applications such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author
profiling. On top of this, I developed software to apply these techniques on
social media.


## Academic Background

After obtaining a BA in Communication and Information Sciences from
Tilburg University, I realized soon enough that Artificial Intelligence and
programming were very much my thing. Hence, I stayed in Tilburg and obtained
an MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude. I wrote quite
the pile of pages that made my master thesis
under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/menno/main) on
discovering
trends in societal debates by means of Supervised Topic Modelling on online
news sources, for which I had the honour of receiving two awards
([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation)
& [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). With my newly
developed admiration for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, I
sought to continue research and applied (and got hired) for a PhD position in
Antwerp. After two years of dilligent work, I was offered to continue my work
and lecture at Tilburg University, where I reside today.

## Development

During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became
an avid Linux user and got very enthusiastic about open-source software, and
thus open data and open science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship
in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of
my student assistantship activites. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for
websites, wrappers, and tools. My latest endeavors include a minimalistic
conference manager ([ebacs](https://www.github.com/cmry/ebacs)), a Python
wrapper for Stanford's Topic Modelling Toolbox
([topbox](https://www.github.com/cmry/topbox)), and an environment for Text
Mining research ([Omesa](https://www.github.com/cmry/omesa)). More details can
be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).
