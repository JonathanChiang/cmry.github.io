I'm a [PhD candidate](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/chris-emmery)
doing research for [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University
of Antwerp under the supervision of
[Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/).
For a period of two years, I will be working for the
[AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/) where my research will mainly be
in the field of Text Mining. During this, I focus on applying Machine Learning
for forensic and online security-related applications such as detection of
cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling.


## Academic Background

After obtaining a BA in Communication and Information Sciences from
Tilburg University, I realized soon enough that Artificial Intelligence and
programming were very much my thing. Hence, I stayed in Tilburg and obtained
an MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude. I wrote quite
the pile of pages that made my master thesis
under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](linky) on discovering
trends in societal debates by means of Supervised Topic Modelling on online
news sources, for which I had the honour of receiving two awards
([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation) & [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). With my newly developed admiration
for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, I sought to continue
research and applied (and got hired) for a PhD position in Antwerp.

## Development

During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became
an avid Linux user and got very enthusiastic about open-source software, and
thus open data and open science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship
in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of
my student assistantship activites. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for
websites, wrappers, and tools. My latest endeavors include a minimalistic
conference manager ([ebacs](https://www.github.com/cmry/ebacs)), a Python
wrapper for Stanford's Topic Modelling Toolbox
([topbox](https://www.github.com/cmry/topbox)), and an environment for Text
Mining research ([Omesa](https://www.github.com/cmry/omesa)). More details can
be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).
