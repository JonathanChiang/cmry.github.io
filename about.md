I'm a [PhD candidate](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/chris-emmery)
doing research for [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University
of Antwerp under the supervision of
[Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/).
For a period of two years, I will be working for the
[AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/) where my research will mainly be
in the field of Text Mining. During this, I focus on applying Machine Learning
for forensic and online security-related applications such as detection of
cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling.


## Academic Background

I hold a BA in Communication and Information Sciences from Tilburg University,
and realized soon enough that Artificial Intelligence and programming were
very much my thing. Hence, I obtained my MSc in Human Aspects of Information
Technology cum laude in Tilburg, and had the honour to receive two awards for
my thesis that I wrote on discovering trends in societal debates by means
of Supervised Topic Modelling on online news sources. With my newly developed
admiration for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, I sought to
continue researching and applied in Antwerp. So here we are.
